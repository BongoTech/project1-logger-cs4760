TITLE:  LOGGER

DESCRIPTION: 

  Logger helps a user log messages. The user can save the log to a file of 
  their choosing. 

FILES:  driver.c loglib.c log.h

TO COMPILE:

  OPTION ONE: Use the supplied Makefile. Type make.
  OPTION TWO: Manually using gcc. Type:
    gcc -c loglib.c
    gcc -c driver.c
    gcc -o driver driver.o loglib.o

TO RUN:

  ./driver [-h] [-t sec] [logfile]

  Where all options are optional.

  -h      displays a help message.

  -t sec  sets a random wait time between prompts with the
          average wait time equal to the integer sec. If the -t
          option is used, sec must be provided. sec is a positive
          integer. The default is 0 seconds of waittime.

  logfile is an option to let the user specify which file they would
          like to save the log to. The default is messages.log.
          NOTE: Any existing file provided to driver will be erased to save
          the log.

VERSION CONTROL:

  This program uses git and github for version control. To see commits, 
  type git log.

NOTES:

  I did not use perror for this assignment because it does not support
  format specifiers. Instead I used fprintf to print to stderr and included
  errno information using strerror().
